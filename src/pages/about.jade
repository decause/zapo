					p web development gets us excited.
						| cool apps get us excited.
						| smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, arduinos, raspberry pis,
						| open-source projects, projection mapping, augmented reality,
						| 3D printing, all get us excited.
					p why? 
						em because technology can be used in more ways than initially imagine.

					p a landscape dominated by desktops has since been flooded with 
						| smartphones, tablets,
						| and gaming consoles that access the web with extra features and capabilities
						| such as touch, geolocation, and retina displays.
						| we will see our world more connected than ever before.
					p one question we keep asking ourselves is.. how do we enrich our physical experience without resorting to a completely 
						| digital solution.

					h3 the web is just the beginning.

				p#founded zapotech was founded by luis rosario.

					//- p studying New Media Development at RIT threw me into a world of programming and attention to design that i had never been aware of. it was there that i became aware that we are in a time where are imagition is our only limiting factor.
					//- p guilty pleasure: support marijuana legalization in NY
					//- p worked at UNICEF Kosovo Innovations Lab.
					//- p i know because i've grown up in it. from my first gaming console (N64) to our
						| first computer (running Windows ME), i've seen the joy and frustration that 
						| both can create (joy: beating Donkey Kong 64, frustration: the Blue Screen of 
						| Death). gaming consoles, 3D, story-telling (movies, tv shows), ipods, iphones, 
						| apps, laptops, raspberry pis, arduino
					//- p one must continue to learn and embrace the best emerging technologies.
						| we understand that the success of a website
						| is dependant on much more than simply writing valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
