      web development gets us excited.
      cool apps get us excited.
      smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, arduinos, raspberry pis,
      open-source projects, projection mapping, augmented reality,
      3D printing, all get us excited.
    </p>
    <p>why? <em>because technology can serve any purpose we can imagine.</em></p>

      a landscape dominated by desktops has since been flooded with 
      smartphones, tablets,
      and gaming consoles that access the web with extra features and capabilities
      such as touch, geolocation, and retina displays.
      we will see our world more connected than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
      one question we keep asking ourselves is.. how do we enrich our physical experience without resorting to a completely 
      digital solution.
